# LogInsight: A Scalable, Multiformat Log Analysis Framework for System Anomalies Detection
A lightweight, scalable, multiformat log analyzer performing anomaly detection and alerting about anomalies.

# Overview
LogInsight is a log analysis tool written in Python that is designed to: extract raw log data from the diverse log sources (Linux-based plaintext logs, JSON-formatted Windows-based logs, generic CSV log files), transform it into the ordered log statements and detect anomalies in real time to gain security-relevant insights into the
system activity.
